### Hi there 👋

<!--
**katiefortier/katiefortier** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

### I’m currently working on starting up the software needed for Computing for Science II.
### I’m currently learning how to setup a github account with a README file.
### I’m looking to collaborate on the individual project for the end of the semester.
### I’m looking for help with getting the github command to work with miniconda.
### Ask me about cats.
